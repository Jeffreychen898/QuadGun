Info

press space to spawn enemies
WASD to move
left click mouse to shoot 4 bullets
right click mouse to shoot 12 bullets
Enemy sits on lava will lose hp
Enemy will lose hp when hit
Enemy will attempt to go to player
Enemy can only shoot 1 bullet

I changed the shooting from space to click because I feel like it would be
easier to shoot.

The player will not lose hp because when he dies, I don't know what to do
since this is not a game.

When player goes out of bounds, it will appear on the other side of the
screen.
